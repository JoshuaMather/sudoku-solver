# sudoku-solver

This is a visual sudoku solver program.

To solve a text file has to be provided that represents a sudoku state.
The file must contain a 9 by 9 grid of numbers which uses 0 to represent and empty space.

Once a file is provided via the console, a window is shown with the inital sudoku state.
A start button can be pressed and the sudoku will be solved, if possible, with the visualisation being updated at every step.
