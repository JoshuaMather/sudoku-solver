display board in window
csp to remove moves that cant be done
attempt moves and backtrack if no further moves can be made
update board with moves
(maybe add counter)

display class
- visual representation of the solving ocurring
- use JPanels and JLabels
(maybe make layout more sudoku-like using a grid and a blank space instead of 0)
- start solving button that starts the recursive solving

sudoku class
- main driver class
- handles reading in text file

square class

- contains value, row, column and box 
- boolean for if it is set in the input file
- contains array of possible values

sudoku state class

CHANGE: Switch to labels
- results in a nicer way of setting and updating values and won't cause the window to flicker when values updated
